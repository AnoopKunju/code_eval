# Code Eval Solutions

## About Code Eval

[Code Eval](https://www.codeeval.com) is a website to challenge programmers
with programming problems intended to help you to improve your programming
skills.

## About this repository

There is my attempt to solve some challenge of this project, using the
Python language. The target is to solve as many as I can, and keep the time
consumed by each script below 10 seconds (at that point the script is
interrupted by Code Eval).

### Contents:

There are 3 directories, `easy/`, `moderate/` and `hard/` corresponding
with the level of the challenges in the website. Inside of each hone are
two types of files, the `*.py2` files are the ones with the code and the
`*.txt` files are those which contains the inputs to test the code.

## About Cheating

Don't cheat! If you cheat, you only fool yourself! If you can't do it, you
can not do it, that's all! Almost you tried, and if you keep learning and
studying, maybe one day you can solve those challenge that seemed so hard a
few early.

Be proud of what you have achieved instead, even if is little. Especially
if your math and programming skills or education is not so vast (as in my
case). I'm very proud to have solved all of this challenge without cheating
or copy another else's solutions. That's the right attitude.

But, once you have a solution, you can learn a lot from the solutions of
others.  That's the purpose of this repository too. Maybe you couldn't
learn a lot from my solutions, maybe even you can laugh of the most naive
ones, but doesn't matter, be humble and remember that even the most idiot
can teach you always something. The second purpose is to have a online
backup of this code, some challenge were hard to break and I would hate to
loose this code.

__The most important thing isn't the Code Eval's rank that you achieve or
the number of challenge that you solved, the most important thing is what
you have learned in the process!__
