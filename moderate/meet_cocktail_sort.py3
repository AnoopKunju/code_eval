Meet Cocktail Sort

Challenge Description:

Quite often we need to arrange items in a certain order: numbers in an
ascending or descending order, words â€“ in an alphabetical order,
people â€“ according to their height, and so on. There are many
different sorting algorithms. Some of them are quick, while others
seem to suit in a particular case only.  In this challenge, your task
is to use a cocktail sort.

Input Sample:

The first argument is a path to a file. Each line includes a test case
with numbers that you need to order using cocktail sort. There is also
a number of iterations for an algorithm to carry out. The numbers
themselves and the number of iterations are separated by a pipeline
'|'.

5 4 9 10 7 3 2 1 6 | 1
9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 | 3

Output Sample:

Print sorted numbers after they pass the required number of
iterations. One iteration of a cocktail sort is a pass through the
list of numbers in both directions: from the beginning to the end and
from the end to the beginning.

1 4 5 9 7 3 2 6 10
1 2 3 6 5 4 7 8 9

Constraints:

The number of iterations can be from 1 to 30.
One iteration of a cocktail sort is a pass through the list of numbers
in both directions: from the beginning to the end and from the end to
the beginning.
The number of test cases is 40.
